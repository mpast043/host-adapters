# ICP - Capacity Governance Runtime

## Primary Customer Profile

- Teams shipping AI agents/tooling in production
- Need enforceable action governance with replayable evidence
- Require host-agnostic integration (OpenClaw, LangGraph, custom hosts)

## Buyer Signals

- Compliance or security ownership on agent operations
- Existing manual policy review bottlenecks
- Need deterministic incident replay and postmortems

## Exclusions

- Teams seeking pure model benchmarking only
- Teams unwilling to run any local governance service

## Core Pain

"We cannot prove what the agent did, why it was allowed, and whether policy was enforced consistently across hosts."

## Value Promise

- Deterministic governance decisions
- Cross-host contract compliance
- Replaypack-based evidence retention
- Fast local-first deployment
