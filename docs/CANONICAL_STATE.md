# Canonical State

Last updated: 2026-02-27

## Canonical Repository

The canonical repository for Framework v4.5 governance and workflow execution is:

- `/tmp/openclaws/Repos/host-adapters`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/mpast043/host-adapters`

Experimental artifacts are separated to:

- `/tmp/openclaws/Repos/host-adapters-experimental-data`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/mpast043/host-adapters-experimental-data`

All execution, validation, and productization work should be authored here first.

## Scope and Intent

This repository is the source of truth for:

- CGF server and host adapters
- WORKFLOW_AUTO execution and artifact contract
- Selection/evidence retention pipeline
- Claim 3P experiment runner and result interpretation

## Source Hierarchy for Physics Evidence

1. Primary sources
- `host-adapters-experimental-data/host-adapters/RUN_*`
- `host-adapters-experimental-data/host-adapters/outputs/physics_audit/*`

2. Secondary sources
- `experiments/README.md`
- runner-level manifests, metrics, verdict files

3. Tertiary sources
- historical consolidated reports, including `CONSOLIDATED_REPORT_CLAIM3P.md`

## Non-Canonical Mirrors

The following are useful references but not canonical for merge decisions:

- `/Users/meganpastore/Clawdbot/.openclaw/workspace`
- `/Users/meganpastore/Clawdbot/Repos/framework-recon-clone`

## Canonicalization Rules

- New workflow artifacts are generated by this repository's tools and stored in the experimental-data repository.
- Historical artifacts are retained and never deleted solely for inconsistency.
- Superseded reports must be explicitly marked as superseded.
- Final claim verdicts must cite exact artifact paths.
